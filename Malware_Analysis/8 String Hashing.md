## ROTR 32 Subroutine

I explained in great detail how this subroutine works.

## HashStringRotr32Sub

This subroutine performs a rotation operation on the input `Value` by `Count` positions to the right while ensuring that the count stays within the valid bit range.

This code block rotates the bits of `Value` to the right by `Count` positions (`Value >> Count`). It then rotates the bits of `Value` to the left by the complement of `Count` (effectively rotating left by `32 - Count` positions) and masks the result with `Mask` to ensure it stays within the valid bit range. Finally, it combines the two results using bitwise OR (`|`).
